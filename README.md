**What happened to Vxalware?**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Without too much water, Vxalware is Dicountinued*

This might not come as a surprise to many as the progress on Vxalware has slowly been going downhill.
Vxalware will probably come back later in the future but for now, I just can't find the time to work
on the script anymore. I have found other meaningful things to do but for now I must say goodbye...

*I will still be leaving some of the scripts that I know in the MainScript.lua section. I am guessing you will like them.*
